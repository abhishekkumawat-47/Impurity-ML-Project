# Machine Learning Model for Predicting Impurity Formation in Drug Synthesis

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project develops machine learning models to predict yield and impurity formation in pharmaceutical synthesis reactions. The models analyze reaction conditions (temperature, concentration, catalysts, etc.) to optimize drug synthesis processes.

## 🔬 Technical Approach
- **Data**: Synthetic reaction dataset with 1200+ experiments
- **Features**: Temperature, concentration, pH, catalysts, solvents, etc.
- **Models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression
- **Evaluation**: R² score, MAE, RMSE with cross-validation
- **Optimization**: Multi-objective optimization (maximize yield, minimize impurity)

## 📊 Key Results
- **Yield Prediction**: R² = 0.67, MAE = 1.40%
- **Impurity Prediction**: R² = 0.83, MAE = 1.80%
- **Feature Importance**: Temperature and catalyst type most critical
- **Optimal Conditions**: Identified best reaction parameters

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Complete ML pipeline from data loading to model deployment
- ✅ Automated hyperparameter tuning and model selection
- ✅ Feature importance analysis with permutation importance
- ✅ Interactive heatmaps for condition optimization
- ✅ Multi-objective optimization for best reaction conditions
- ✅ Professional visualizations and reporting
